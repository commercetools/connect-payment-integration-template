# connect-payment-integration-template
This repository provides a [connect](https://docs.commercetools.com/connect) template for payment integration connector. This boilerplate code acts as a starting point for integration with external payment service provider.

## Template Features
- Typescript language supported.
- Uses Fastify as web server framework.
- Uses [commercetools SDK](https://docs.commercetools.com/sdk/js-sdk-getting-started) for the commercetools-specific communication.
- Uses [connect payment SDK](https://github.com/commercetools/connect-payments-sdk) to manage request context, sessions and JWT authentication.
- Includes local development utilities in npm commands to build, start, test, lint & prettify code.

## Prerequisite
#### 1. commercetools composable commerce API client
Users are expected to create API client responsible for payment management in composable commerce project. Details of the API client are taken as input as environment variables/ configuration for connect such as `CTP_PROJECT_KEY` , `CTP_CLIENT_ID`, `CTP_CLIENT_SECRET`, `CTP_SCOPE`, `CTP_REGION`. For details, please read [Deployment Configuration](./README.md#deployment-configuration).
In addition, please make sure the API client should have enough scope to be able to manage payment. For details, please refer to [Running Application](./processor/README.md#running-application)

#### 2. various URLs from commercetools composable commerce
Various URLs from commercetools platform are required to be configured so that the connect application can handle session and authentication process for endpoints.
Their values are taken as input as environment variables/ configuration for connect with variable names `CTP_API_URL`, `CTP_AUTH_URL` and `CTP_SESSION_URL`.
 
## Getting started
The template contains two modules :  
- Enabler: Acts as a wrapper implementation in which frontend components from PSPs embedded. It gives control to checkout product on when and how to load the connector frontend based on business configuration. In cases connector is used directly and not through Checkout product, the connector library can be loaded directly on frontend than the PSP one.
- Processor : Acts as backend services which is middleware to 3rd party PSPs to be responsible for managing transactions with PSPs and updating payment entity in composable commerce.  `connect-payment-sdk` will be offered to be used in connector to manage request context, sessions and other tools necessary to transact.

Regarding the development of processor module, please refer to the following documentations:
- [Development of Processor](./processor/README.md)

#### 1. Develop your specific needs 
To proceed payment operations via external PSPs, users need to extend this connector with the following task
- API communication: Implementation to communicate between this connector application and the external system using libraries provided by PSPs. Please remember that the payment requests might not be sent to PSPs successfully in a single attempt. It should have needed retry and recovery mechanism.

#### 2. Register as connector in commercetools Connect
Follow guidelines [here](https://docs.commercetools.com/connect/getting-started) to register the connector for public/private use.

## Deployment Configuration
In order to deploy your customized connector application on commercetools Connect, it needs to be published. For details, please refer to [documentation about commercetools Connect](https://docs.commercetools.com/connect/concepts)
In addition, in order to support connect, the tax integration connector template has a folder structure as listed below
```
├── enabler
│   ├── src
│   ├── test
│   └── package.json
├── processor
│   ├── src
│   ├── test
│   └── package.json
└── connect.yaml
```

Connect deployment configuration is specified in `connect.yaml` which is required information needed for publishing of the application. Following is the deployment configuration used by full ingestion and incremental updater modules
```
deployAs:
  - name: processor
    applicationType: service
    endpoint: /

      securedConfiguration:
        - key: CTP_PROJECT_KEY

        - key: CTP_CLIENT_ID
          description: Commercetools client ID
        - key: CTP_CLIENT_SECRET

        - key: CTP_SCOPE
          description: Commercetools client scope
        - key: CTP_REGION
          description: Region of Commercetools project
        - key: CTP_AUTH_URL
          description: Commercetools Auth URL
        - key: CTP_API_URL
          description: Commercetools API URL
        - key: CTP_SESSION_URL
          description: Session API URL
  - name: enabler

```

Here you can see the details about various variables in configuration
- CTP_PROJECT_KEY: The key of commercetools composable commerce project.
- CTP_CLIENT_ID: The client ID of your commercetools composable commerce user account. It is used in commercetools client to communicate with commercetools composable commerce via SDK.
- CTP_CLIENT_SECRET: The client secret of commercetools composable commerce user account. It is used in commercetools client to communicate with commercetools composable commerce via SDK.
- CTP_SCOPE: The scope constrains the endpoints to which the commercetools client has access, as well as the read/write access right to an endpoint.
- CTP_REGION: As the commercetools composable commerce APIs are provided in six different region, it defines the region which your commercetools composable commerce user account belongs to.
- CTP_AUTH_URL: The URL for authentication in commercetools platform. It is used to generate OAuth 2.0 token which is required in every API call to commercetools composable commerce. The default value is `https://auth.europe-west1.gcp.commercetools.com`. For details, please refer to documentation [here](https://docs.commercetools.com/tutorials/api-tutorial#authentication).
- CTP_API_URL: The URL for commercetools composable commerce API. Default value is `https://api.europe-west1.gcp.commercetools.com`.
- CTP_SESSION_URL: The URL for session creation in commercetools platform. Connectors relies on the session created to be able to share information between enabler and processor. The default value is `https://session-dev.europe-west1.gcp.commercetools.com`.
