# Payment Integration Enabler
This module provides an application based on [commercetools Connect](https://docs.commercetools.com/connect), which acts a wrapper implementation to cover frontend components provided by Payment Service Providers (PSPs)

PSPs provide libraries that can be used on client side to load on browser or other user agent which securely load DOM elements for payment methods and/or payment fields inputs. These libraries take control on saving PAN data of customer and reduce PCI scopes of the seller implementation. Now, with the usage of `enabler`, it allows the control to checkout product on when and how to load the `enabler` as connector UI based on business configuration. In cases connector is used directly and not through Checkout product, this connector UI can be loaded directly on frontend than the libraries provided by PSPs.
